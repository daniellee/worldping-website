A raintank private collector provides the execution of periodic network performance tests including HTTP checks, DNS and Ping. The results of each test are then transfered back to the Raintank API where they are processed and inserted into a timeseries database.

raintank-collector is installed and managed on your infrastructure and always 100% open source. 

The latest version and installation instructions are available on [Github](https://github.com/raintank/raintank-collector)
