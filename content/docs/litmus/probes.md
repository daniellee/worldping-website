The raintank probe provides the execution of periodic network performance tests including HTTP checks, DNS and Ping. The results of each test are then transfered back to the Raintank API where they are processed and inserted into our hosted timeseries database.

Raintank mantains a growing number of official probes across the world ([View our global footprint](/docs/litmus/global-footprint)), but you can also add [Private Probes](/docs/litmus/private-probes)
