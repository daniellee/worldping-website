Litmus ships with a handful of starter dashboards to help you view and act on your data. These dashboards are read-only, and are updated frequently. To modify dashboards, click the gear icon in the dashboard header and select **Save As...**. Once a copy has been made, the dashboard is fully within your control. Updates will not change these new dashboards.

### Dashboard Organization

The bulk of dashboards are centered on individual endpoints. Once selecting a single endpoint, you are able to filter the data based on some or all of global collectors.
