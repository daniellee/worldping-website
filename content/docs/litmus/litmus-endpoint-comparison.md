The endpoint comparison dashboard is the best way to see trends for multiple endpoints across multiple probes.

1. `Template Variables`: The template variables allows multi-select of both endpoints and probes for a single protocol. 
2. `Overall Performance`: All selected probes are averaged into a series line, per endpoint. 
3. `Performance by Probe`: Using dynamic repeating panels, a graph is displayed for each selected probe.
