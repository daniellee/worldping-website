          <!-- <h3 class="section-title">What does Litmus do?</h3>
          <p>Litmus checks the data quality of any web app from anywhere. You can use it to test your website or your application, whether you’ve got a complex globally distributed infrastructure or a simple blog.</p>
          -->
          <h3 class="section-title">I still don’t get it. Can you give me an example?</h3>
          <p>Let’s say you run an e-commerce application. You can use Litmus to get a real-time view of its performance and availability. As often as every 10 seconds, Litmus will test your application from dozens of Collectors around the world in the markets that are important to you.
          Litmus will alert you in real-time if there are any outages or slow-downs, and help you keep track of your performance, and even compare them to your competitors. 
          When you have a problem, Litmus will send you a high quality and speedy alert. It also helps triage by pinpointing the problem to a particular region or part of your stack.
          It does all of this via external probes; you don’t have to install or configure any software or agents.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Which protocols does Litmus support?</h3>
          <p>Litmus can test, store, visualize, and alert on the following protocols about your endpoint:
          <ul>
            <li>Ping uptime and performance  (eg. latency, loss, jitter)</li>
            <li>DNS uptime and performance (eg. latency, responses)</li>
            <li>HTTP(s) uptime and performance</li>
          </ul>
          You can configure each endpoint to your exact needs, but we will autosuggest protocols based on what we can probe.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Is Litmus open-source?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Everything we do at raintank is open-source. Litmus is provided under a permissive Apache license, just like Grafana. You can run it on-premise, or in the cloud as an OpenSaaS service that is fully supported by raintank. 
          We believe all infrastructure software is destined to be open-source. Litmus allows you to avoid lock-in and take back control of your data destiny.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Why should I use Litmus? How is it different?</h3>
          <p>The network performance monitoring space is certainly crowded. There are a wealth of players from the low-end (eg. Pingdom) to the high-end (eg. Catchpoint, ThousandEyes). Litmus is our vision of how NPM should be done, but we believe it’s more important to get a “big picture” of your infrastructure that brings information from different parts of your stack together. 
          Since Litmus is built on top of Grafana, you can add your existing data sources and visualize and alert on your existing data side-by-side with Litmus. It’s a great way to easily get started with Grafana. Raintank will be announcing additional integrations that will bring in other parts of your stack together under a common platform.
          You can test your application as often as every 10 seconds from dozens of Collectors around the world. This means you can catch micro-outages that might not otherwise show up, be alerted much faster, and troubleshoot in real-time. This kind of resolution and metric volume would normally cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars per month with other providers.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Why is Litmus free?</h3>
          <p>We’re building the raintank OpenSaaS platform, and Litmus is the first step in that journey. We want to create a world class metrics-as-a-service platform that brings data about your entire stack together.
          Litmus is currently in beta and is helping us stress-test that platform. We need your help to get us to a final release. Your suggestions and feedback are invaluable, so we’ve decided to make Litmus free (with some reasonable limits) during the beta.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">I want to add a large amount of Endpoints or Collectors. Can you raise my limits?</h3>
          <p>Sure, we’d love to! Just drop us a note and we’d be happy to upgrade you and get you what you need. No charge. Our only ask is that you give us feedback.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">I don’t want to use the UI. I need to automate. Do you have an API?</h3>
          <p>Of course! We have a fully featured HTTP API. Anything that you can do through the UI you can also do through the API. Many Litmus users have a central “source of truth” and our API makes it easy to integrate with.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">What’s next for Litmus?</h3>
          <p>Litmus is under active development, and is being shaped by your feedback and suggestions. For more information, check out our <a href="/litmus/road-map">roadmap</a></p>
