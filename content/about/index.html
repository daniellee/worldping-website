          <p>It's become a massive hallucination. People get bombarded with confusing alerts, so they can stare at nonsensical charts while half awake, just to see if a problem even exists.</p>
          <p><strong>data deluge</strong> Traffic's way up, but so is the amount of metrics, messages and alerts from your ever-growing stack.</p>
          <p><strong>terrible choices</strong> A proprietary solution? SaaS? It'll be expensive, and you'll lose control. Open source? Could be a time sink.</p>
          <p><strong>fractured vision</strong> You want correlation and collaboration, across your whole stack. Disparate tools and data make seeing the whole picture hard.</p>

      <p class="lead">an opensaas monitoring engine</p>
      <p>We believe all infrastructure platform software is destined to be open source. Our OpenSaaS platform combines the turnkey and scalable nature of a SaaS offering, with all of the advantages of open source software. Run raintank in the cloud, in your datacenter, or as a hybrid deployment. Take back control of your data and destiny, and eliminate lockÂ­-in.</p>

      <p class="lead">that's gorgeously powerful,</p>
      <p>Leveraging Grafana, the leading open source metrics dashboard, we are building a gorgeously powerful frontend that allows you to view, distill and share clear insights about your infrastructure. Grafana2 will plug into raintank to provide a beautiful and seamless experience that democratizes monitoring. Who said open source wasn't sexy?</p>

      <p class="lead">and unifies data and understanding.</p>
      <p>Already have Graphite? OpenTSDB? InfluxDB? Connect it to the platform, whether that data is on-premise or in the cloud. Add tons of capabilities around these existing databases, and get a unified view of what's going on. Users, networks, applications, instances, devices and zones: we look at all horizons of your stack. This broad view allows for unprecedented context and situational awareness.</p>
